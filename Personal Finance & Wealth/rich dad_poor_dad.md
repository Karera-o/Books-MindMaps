# Rich Dad Poor Dad (Central Idea)

- **Definition**: Financial independence comes from understanding money, assets, and liabilities, guided by contrasting lessons from a "rich dad" and a "poor dad."

## Mindset and Financial Education

- ### The Rich Think Differently

  - Wealth is about mindset, not just income.
  - Focus on financial freedom over job security.
- ### Education Beyond School

  - Traditional education teaches earning, not managing money.
  - Self-education in finance is key to success.
- ### Poor Dad vs. Rich Dad Philosophy

  - Poor Dad: "I can’t afford it" (limiting belief).
  - Rich Dad: "How can I afford it?" (problem-solving mindset).

## Assets vs. Liabilities

- ### Understanding Assets

  - Assets put money in your pocket (e.g., stocks, real estate).
  - Build a portfolio of income-generating assets.
- ### Understanding Liabilities

  - Liabilities take money out (e.g., cars, mortgages if not managed).
  - Avoid mistaking liabilities for assets (e.g., a house as an "asset").
- ### The Golden Rule

  - Buy assets first, not luxuries.
  - Let assets fund your lifestyle.

## Making Money Work for You
