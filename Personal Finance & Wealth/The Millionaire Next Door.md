# The Millionaire Next Door (Central Idea)

- **Definition**: A study revealing that America’s millionaires often live modestly, accumulate wealth through frugality, hard work, and smart financial habits—not inheritance or flashy lifestyles.

## Core Findings

  - Most millionaires aren’t glamorous or high-profile.
  - They’re often “next door”—unassuming neighbors.
- ### Research Basis

  - Surveys of 1,000+ high-net-worth individuals.
  - Focus on self-made millionaires, not the elite.
- ### Wealth vs. Income

  - High income doesn’t guarantee wealth.
