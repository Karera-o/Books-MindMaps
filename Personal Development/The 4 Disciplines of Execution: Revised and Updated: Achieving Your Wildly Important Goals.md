# The 4 Disciplines of Execution (Central Idea)

- **Definition**: A proven system to achieve wildly important goals (WIGs) by focusing effort, measuring progress, and sustaining execution amidst the daily whirlwind.

## Core Principles

- ### Execution Gap

  - Most fail not from bad strategy, but poor execution.
  - Discipline closes the gap between goals and results.
- ### Focus on the Vital Few

  - Prioritize what matters most over doing everything.
  - Clarity drives achievement.
- ### Behavior Drives Results

  - Change how people act to change outcomes.
  - Execution is a human system, not just a plan.

## The Whirlwind

- **Definition**
  - Day-to-day tasks competing with strategic goals.
  - Necessary but distracting.
- **Key Ideas**
  - WIGs lose to the whirlwind without focus.
  - Example: Urgent emails burying big projects.

## The 4 Disciplines

- ### Discipline 1: Focus on the Wildly Important

  - **Definition**
    - Select 1-2 critical goals (WIGs) with massive impact.
    - Say no to good but less vital ideas.
  - **Key Ideas**
    - Narrow focus: “If everything’s important, nothing is.”
    - Example: “Increase revenue 20% by Q4.”
- ### Discipline 2: Act on Lead Measures

  - **Definition**
    - Target predictive, influenceable actions, not lag results.
    - Lead measures drive WIG success.
  - **Key Ideas**
    - Lag: Revenue (outcome); Lead: Sales calls (action).
    - Example: “Make 50 prospect calls weekly.”
- ### Discipline 3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard

  - **Definition**
    - Track progress visually to engage and motivate.
    - Simple, team-owned metrics.
  - **Key Ideas**
    - Players play harder when they see the score.
    - Example: Chart of calls made vs. goal.
- ### Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of Accountability

  - **Definition**
    - Hold regular WIG sessions to review and commit.
    - Weekly rhythm sustains focus.
  - **Key Ideas**
    - Report, review, plan—15-20 minutes.
    - Example: “What did I do last week for the WIG?”
