## The Fundamentals of Habits

- ### Why Tiny Changes Matter

  - Incremental progress compounds over time.
  - The 1% better every day principle.
- ### Habits as Compound Interest

  - Small actions accumulate into big outcomes.

- ### Focus on Systems, Not Goals

  - Habits are about processes, not just end results.
  - Goals set direction; systems drive progress.

## The Habit Loop

- ### Cue

  - Triggers that initiate a behavior.
  - Make cues obvious to start habits.
- ### Craving

  - Motivational force behind the habit.
  - Increase desire to make habits stick.
- ### Response

  - The actual behavior or action.
  - Keep it simple to ensure consistency.
- ### Reward

  - The benefit that reinforces the habit.
  - Make rewards satisfying to repeat the loop.
