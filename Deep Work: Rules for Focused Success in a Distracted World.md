  - Requires intentional habits and discipline.

## Key Concepts

  - **Definition**
    - Professional tasks done in a state of distraction-free focus.
    - Maximizes cognitive capacity.
  - **Key Ideas**
    - Produces rare, high-quality output.
    - Example: Writing a book in focused blocks.
- ### Shallow Work

  - **Definition**
    - Low-value, distracted tasks (e.g., email, scrolling).
    - Easy but unremarkable.
  - **Key Ideas**
    - Fills time, limits deep impact.

    - Example: Newport’s academic writing schedule.
- ### Rule 2: Embrace Boredom

  - **Definition**
    - Train your mind to resist constant stimulation.
    - Boredom strengthens focus muscle.
  - **Strategies**
    - Schedule breaks from focus, not vice versa.

- ### Rule 4: Drain the Shallows

  - **Definition**
    - Reduce shallow work to free time for depth.
    - Delegate or eliminate low-impact tasks.
  - **Strategies**
    - Cap shallow time (e.g., 30% of day).
    - Example: Batch emails once daily.

## Supporting Insights
