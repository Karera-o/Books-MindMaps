# Design Thinking for Software Engineering

- Core Concept: Human-Centered Software

  - Why It Matters
    - Software impacts daily life
    - Needs to serve users, not just specs
  - Bridging Gaps
    - Design thinking + software engineering
    - Complementary, not exclusive
  - Goal
    - Innovative, user-oriented systems
    - Balance tech and human needs
- Design Thinking Basics

  - What It Is
    - Human-centric problem-solving
    - Iterative, creative approach
  - Key Elements
    - Mindset: Empathy, openness
    - Process: Empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test
    - Toolbox: Practical methods
  - Relevance
    - Breaks from rigid tech focus
    - Fosters innovation
- Software Engineering Context

  - Traditional Limits
    - Requirements engineering often rigid
    - Misses fuzzy human needs
  - User-Centric Design (UX)
    - Focuses on usability
    - Still needs broader integration
  - Opportunity
    - Combine with design thinking
    - Example: Agile + DT synergy
- Integration Strategies

  - Upfront Design Thinking
    - Kick off with user insights
    - Shape early requirements
  - Infused Design Thinking
    - Blend throughout development
    - Continuous empathy loops
  - Continuous Design Thinking
    - Ongoing iteration
    - Adapt to user feedback
