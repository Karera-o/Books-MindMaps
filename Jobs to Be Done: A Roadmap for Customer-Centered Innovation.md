# Jobs to Be Done: A Roadmap for Customer-Centered Innovation

*(A framework for understanding customer needs and driving innovation)*

---

## Core Concepts

- **Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Theory**
  - Customers "hire" products/services to get a job done
  - Focus on the underlying need, not the product
  - Jobs are functional, emotional, and social
- **Key Principles**
  - Jobs are stable, solutions evolve
  - Context is critical (when, where, why)
  - Metrics for success vary by job

---

## Understanding Jobs

- **Identifying Jobs**
  - Observing customer behavior
  - Conducting interviews to uncover unmet needs
  - Analyzing pain points and trade-offs
- **Categorizing Jobs**
  - Core jobs (primary tasks)
  - Related jobs (secondary tasks)
  - Emotional jobs (feelings and desires)
- **Job Statements**
  - Clear, actionable phrasing (e.g., "When ___, I want to ___, so I can ___")
  - Focus on the outcome, not the process
