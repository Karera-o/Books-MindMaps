# Thinking, Fast and Slow

- Two Systems of Thinking

  - System 1 - Fast Thinking
    - Automatic, instinctive, and quick
    - Relies on heuristics
    - Effortless but prone to errors
    - Examples: Recognizing faces, simple math (2+2)
  - System 2 - Slow Thinking
    - Deliberate, logical, and effortful
    - Used for complex problem-solving
    - Requires focus and mental energy
    - Examples: Solving 17x24, critical analysis
- Heuristics and Biases

  - Availability Heuristic
    - Judging likelihood based on ease of recall
    - Influenced by vividness or recent events
    - Example: Overestimating plane crash risk after news
  - Anchoring Effect
    - Initial information skews judgment
    - Even irrelevant numbers influence estimates
    - Example: Pricing influenced by random high/low anchor
  - Representativeness Heuristic
    - Judging probability by similarity to stereotypes
    - Ignores base rates
    - Example: Assuming a shy person is a librarian
- Overconfidence

  - Illusion of Understanding
    - Believing we know more than we do
    - Narrative fallacy: Creating coherent stories from chaos
  - Overestimation of Skills
    - Most people rate themselves above average
    - Example: 90% of drivers think theyâ€™re better than average
  - Failure to Predict
    - Experts overestimate accuracy of forecasts
    - Randomness often overlooked
- Prospect Theory

  - Loss Aversion
    - Losses feel worse than gains feel good
    - People avoid risks to prevent loss
    - Example: Keeping a bad investment to avoid realizing loss
  - Framing Effects
    - Decisions depend on how options are presented
    - Positive vs. negative framing shifts choices
    - Example: 90% success vs. 10% failure rate
  - Reference Points
    - Value judged relative to a baseline
    - Changes perception of gains/losses
- The Experiencing vs. Remembering Self

  - Experiencing Self
    - Lives in the moment
    - Focuses on current sensations and emotions
  - Remembering Self
    - Evaluates life based on memories
    - Biased by peaks, ends, and duration neglect
    - Example: A painful procedure judged by its worst moment
  - Implications for Happiness
    - Choices prioritize remembering self over experiencing self
    - Conflicts in life satisfaction judgments
- Practical Applications

  - Decision-Making
    - Awareness of biases improves choices
    - Slowing down activates System 2
  - Economics and Policy
    - Challenges rational agent model
    - Nudges to guide better behavior
  - Personal Reflection
    - Recognizing limits of intuition
    - Balancing fast and slow thinking
