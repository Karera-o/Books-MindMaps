## Core Principles of Design Thinking

- **Human-Centered Approach**
  - Focus on understanding people’s needs and experiences
  - Empathy as the foundation for problem-solving
  - Co-creation with stakeholders
- **Iterative Process**
  - Embrace experimentation and prototyping
  - Learn from failures and refine solutions
  - Continuously iterate based on feedback
- **Holistic Problem-Solving**
  - Address root causes, not just symptoms
  - Consider the broader system and context
  - Balance desirability, feasibility, and viability

## The Design Thinking Process

1. **Empathize**
   - Observe and engage with users to understand their needs
   - Use interviews, surveys, and immersion techniques
   - Build empathy maps and personas
2. **Define**
   - Frame the problem clearly and concisely
   - Identify the core challenge to address
   - Create a problem statement or “How Might We” question
3. **Ideate**
   - Generate a wide range of creative solutions
   - Use brainstorming, mind mapping, and other ideation techniques
   - Encourage wild ideas and build on others’ suggestions
4. **Prototype**
   - Build low-fidelity prototypes to test ideas
   - Use sketches, models, or role-playing
   - Focus on learning, not perfection
5. **Test**
   - Gather feedback from users through testing
   - Iterate based on insights and observations
   - Refine the solution until it meets user needs
