- The Hooked Model

  - Trigger
    - External triggers
      - Prompts like notifications or ads
      - Example: Email alert for a new message
    - Internal triggers
      - Emotions or routines cue usage
      - Example: Boredom leads to scrolling social media
  - Action
    - Simple behavior done in anticipation of reward
      - Must be easy to do (Fogg Behavior Model: Motivation, Ability, Trigger)
    - Examples: Clicking a button, swiping a screen
  - Variable Reward
    - Unpredictable outcomes keep users engaged
      - Types: Rewards of the tribe, hunt, self
    - Examples: Likes on a post, new content feed, personal achievement
  - Investment
    - User puts something into the product
      - Time, data, effort, or social capital
    - Increases commitment and future triggers
      - Example: Building a playlist or profile
