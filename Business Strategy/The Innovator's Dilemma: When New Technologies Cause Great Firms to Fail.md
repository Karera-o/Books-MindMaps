  - Often start as inferior solutions but improve over time
  - Examples: Digital cameras disrupting film, smartphones disrupting feature phones
- **Sustaining Innovation**
  - Improvements to existing products or services
  - Focus on meeting the needs of current customers
  - Examples: Faster processors, better camera quality in smartphones

## The Innovator's Dilemma Explained

- **Why Great Companies Fail**
  - They focus on sustaining innovations for their best customers
  - They ignore or underestimate disruptive technologies
  - They are trapped by their own success and processes
- **The Dilemma**
  - Investing in disruptive technologies often doesn’t make sense initially
  - Disruptive markets are small and unprofitable at first
  - Existing customers don’t want disruptive products initially

## Characteristics of Disruptive Technologies

- **Performance Trajectory**
  - Starts below the performance needs of mainstream customers
  - Improves rapidly over time, eventually meeting and exceeding needs
- **Market Trajectory**
  - Targets underserved or non-consumers initially
  - Expands into mainstream markets as performance improves
- **Business Model Impact**
  - Often requires a different business model
  - May cannibalize existing revenue streams

## How Disruption Happens

- **Emerging Markets**
  - Disruptive technologies often create entirely new markets
  - Examples: Personal computers, online streaming
- **Low-End Disruption**
  - Targets customers who are overserved by existing solutions
  - Examples: Budget airlines, discount retailers
- **New-Market Disruption**
  - Attracts non-consumers who previously couldn’t access the product
  - Examples: Digital cameras, smartphones

## Why Companies Struggle with Disruption

- **Resource Allocation**
  - Companies allocate resources to projects with the highest returns
  - Disruptive projects often don’t meet short-term financial goals
- **Processes and Values**
  - Established processes are optimized for sustaining innovations
  - Company values prioritize current customers over new markets
- **Customer Dependence**
  - Companies focus on meeting the needs of their best customers
  - Disruptive technologies often don’t align with these needs initially

## Strategies for Overcoming the Dilemma

- **Create Autonomous Units**
  - Spin off separate teams or divisions to focus on disruptive innovations
  - Allow them to operate independently with their own processes and metrics
- **Embrace Small Markets**
  - Be willing to invest in small, emerging markets
  - Recognize that these markets may grow into significant opportunities
- **Develop a Disruptive Mindset**
  - Encourage experimentation and risk-taking
  - Be willing to cannibalize existing products if necessary
