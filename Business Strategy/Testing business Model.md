# Testing Business Ideas (Central Idea)

- **Definition**: A practical guide to systematically test business ideas using rapid experiments to reduce risk and increase success.

## Core Principles

- ### Why Test Ideas?

  - 7 out of 10 new products fail due to untested assumptions.
  - Testing minimizes wasted time, money, and resources.
- ### Experimentation Mindset

  - Shift from intuition to evidence-based decisions.
  - Make testing a continuous, repeatable process.
- ### Integration with Tools

  - Builds on Business Model Canvas and Value Proposition Canvas.
  - Adds lean startup-style experiments for validation.

## The Testing Process

- ### Define

  - **Identify Assumptions**
    - Break ideas into testable hypotheses.
    - Focus on desirability, feasibility, viability.
  - **Prioritize Risks**
    - Rank assumptions by impact and uncertainty.
    - Tackle the riskiest first.
- ### Design

  - **Choose Experiments**
    - Select from 44 experiment types (e.g., interviews, prototypes).
    - Match experiment to evidence strength needed.
  - **Set Metrics**
    - Define clear success criteria.
    - Measure progress objectively.
- ### Test

  - **Run Experiments**
    - Conduct rapid, low-cost tests (e.g., landing pages, MVPs).
    - Gather real-world data from customers.
  - **Learn and Adapt**
    - Analyze results to validate or pivot.
    - Iterate based on evidence.

## Experiment Library

- ### Discovery Experiments

  - **Customer Interviews**
    - Understand needs and pain points.
    - Low cost, quick insights.
  - **Landing Pages**
    - Test demand with minimal product.
    - Measure clicks and sign-ups.
- ### Validation Experiments

  - **Prototypes**
    - Test usability and appeal (paper, clickable).
    - Refine based on feedback.
  - **Pre-Sales**
    - Sell before building to confirm demand.
    - Strong evidence of viability.
- ### Scaling Experiments

  - **Split Tests**
    - Compare variations (e.g., pricing, features).
    - Optimize based on performance.
  - **Wizard of Oz**
    - Simulate full service manually.
    - Test feasibility before automation.

## Key Frameworks

- ### Assumptions Mapping

  - Plot assumptions by importance and evidence.
  - Focus testing where evidence is weak.
- ### Experiment Selection

  - Balance setup time, run time, and evidence strength.
  - Examples: Surveys (fast, weak) vs. MVPs (slower, strong).
- ### Testing Card

  - Structure experiments with hypothesis, method, and criteria.
  - Standardize the process for teams.

## Organizational Impact

- ### Build a Testing Culture

  - Encourage experimentation across teams.
  - Leaders model risk-taking and learning.
- ### Scale Testing

  - Use ceremonies (e.g., review sessions) to share progress.
  - Develop a shared language for experimentation.
- ### Avoid Pitfalls

  - Over-reliance on gut feelings or focus groups.
  - Premature scaling without validation.

## Mindset Shifts

- ### Embrace Uncertainty

  - Treat every idea as an experiment.
  - Failure is learning, not loss.
- ### Act Fast

  - Speed beats perfection in early stages.
  - Iterate quickly to find what works.
- ### Evidence Over Opinions

  - Data trumps debates.
  - Build confidence with validated insights.
