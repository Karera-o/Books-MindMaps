## Core Principles

- **The Mom Test Rule**
  - Ask questions that even your mom can’t lie about
  - Focus on past behaviors and specific facts, not hypotheticals
  - Avoid leading questions that bias responses
- **Why People Lie**
  - They want to be polite or avoid hurting your feelings
  - They speculate about future behavior instead of recalling past actions
  - They tell you what they think you want to hear

## Effective Customer Conversations

- **Asking the Right Questions**
  - Focus on specific, concrete experiences
  - Ask about past behaviors instead of future intentions
  - Dig into problems, not solutions
- **Avoiding Bad Questions**
  - Hypotheticals (e.g., "Would you buy this?")
  - Leading questions (e.g., "Don’t you think this is a great idea?")
  - Generic praise (e.g., "Do you like this?")
- **Listening for Insights**
  - Pay attention to emotional language and pain points
  - Look for patterns across multiple conversations
  - Identify gaps between what people say and what they do
