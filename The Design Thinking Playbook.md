    - Example: "How might we improve remote collaboration?"
- ### Explore

  - **Ideation**
    - Generate diverse, bold ideas.
    - Techniques: Brainstorming, mind mapping.
  - **Prototyping**
    - Build tangible solutions quickly.
    - Examples: Mockups, digital wireframes.
- ### Materialize

  - **Testing**
    - Gather feedback from real users.
    - Iterate based on insights.
  - **Implementation**
    - Scale validated solutions mindfully.
    - Integrate into digital systems or ecosystems.

## Applications

- ### Teams

  - **Collaboration**
    - Foster cross-functional creativity.
    - Use digital tools (e.g., Miro) for remote ideation.
  - **Mindful Culture**
    - Encourage openness and psychological safety.
    - Avoid burnout in digital workflows.
- ### Products

  - **User-Centric Design**
    - Create intuitive, valuable products.
    - Example: App solving a specific pain point.
